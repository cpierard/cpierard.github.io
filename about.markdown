<p align="justify"> I'm a student in the last year of the Master in Environmental Fluid Mechanics, which I am currently reading at the Université Grenoble Alpes with the support of the ‘Make Our Planet Great Again’ scholarship on climate science, awarded by the Government of France.</p>

<p align="justify"> During my career, I have worked on research projects related to Atmospheric Physics and Physical Oceanography that involved numerical simulations, data processing and observational fieldwork.</p>

<p align="justify"> My main area of interest is the study of large scale flows in the ocean and the atmosphere using numerical simulations and direct observations. In particular, I believe in the necessity of doing intelligent simplifications of a problem and constructing simple models to understand the underlying physics of certain processes in the climate system.</p>

<p align="justify"> In my free time, I like spending time outdoors and reading about exploration. Also, I'm a diver, with a cave diving license, and an occasional climber. Lately, I'm rediscovering cycling and I love it!</p>
