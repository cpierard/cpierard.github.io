<p align="justify"> I'm a student in the last year of the Master in Environmental Fluid Mechanics at the Université Grenoble Alpes, with the support of the ‘Make Our Planet Great Again’ scholarship on climate science, awarded by the Government of France.</p>

<p align="justify"> During my career, I have worked on research projects related to Atmospheric Physics and Physical Oceanography that involved numerical simulations, data processing and observational fieldwork.</p>

<p align="justify"> My main area of interest is the study of large scale flows in the ocean and the atmosphere using numerical simulations and direct observations. I believe in the necessity of doing intelligent simplifications of problems and in constructing simple models to understand the underlying physics of certain processes of the climate system.</p>

<p align="justify"> In my free time I like spending time outdoors and reading about exploration. I'm a diver, with a cave diving license, and an occasional climber. Lately, I've been rediscovering cycling and I love it!</p>
