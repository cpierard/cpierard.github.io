<p align="justify"> I'm a PhD candidate at Utrecht University, studying the transport of nanoplastics in our ocean. I'm working at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/onderzoek/imau">IMAU</a>, with the
<a href="https://oceanparcels.org/utrechtteam">OceanParcels</a> and <a href="http://nanoplastics.org/">Nanoplastics</a> groups. </p>

<!--<p align="justify"> During my career, I have worked on research projects related to Atmospheric Physics and Physical Oceanography that involved numerical simulations, data processing and observational fieldwork.</p>  />-->

<p align="justify"> I'm interested in the study of large scale flows in the ocean using numerical simulations and direct observations. I believe in the necessity of doing intelligent simplifications of problems and in constructing simple models to understand the underlying physics of certain processes.</p>

<p align="justify"> I'm interested in ocean pollution from a socio-political point of view and the Blue Commons. I also love caves! Especially if they are flooded 🦐🔦.</p>
