<p align="justify"> I'm a physicist with a PhD in Physical Oceanography from Utrecht University, currently working at The Ocean Cleanup. </p>

<p align="justify"> During my career, I have worked on research projects related to atmospheric physics and physical oceanography that involved numerical simulations, data processing and observational fieldwork. During my PhD I developed an interest in new statistical methods, such as Bayesian inference and information theory, for the analysis of geophysical data.</p> 

<!-- <p align="justify"> I am curious about flows in the ocean and atmosphere and using numerical simulations and direct observations to study them. I believe in the necessity of doing intelligent simplifications of problems and in constructing simple models to understand the underlying physics of certain processes. </p> -->

<p align="justify"> I'm interested in contributing to innovative science-based projects that boost the Blue Economy.</p>
