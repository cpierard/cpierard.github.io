title:  "Measurement of Turbulence in Katabatic Winds on a Steep Slope"
permalink: /projects/katabatic/
---

I am working at the Institut des Géosciences de l’Environnement at Grenoble doing an internship, as part of my master’s program. The project aims to characterize turbulence on katabatic winds on a steep alpine slope, using 3D sonic anemometers. This study is relevant because the cold winds have a strong influence on the weather in valleys and can cause inversions that are linked to bad air quality, especially during winter. For the second year of the program, I will change my research topic moving to a project on Physical Oceanography, to focus my formation into that field.
