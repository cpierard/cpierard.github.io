title:  "Glider Deployment Mission in the Gulf of Mexico"

In 2017, I collaborated in the assembling, testing, and deployment of a Glider (SG622) with the Oceanographic Monitoring Group (CICESE), which is currently sampling the mesoscale eddies in the Gulf of Mexico. This immersive experience introduced me to the technological breakthroughs in Oceanography and to the interaction between the dynamics of ocean structures and its biological and chemical processes. Besides classical hydrographic, those gliders also measure Chlorophyll, revealing processes that were not seen before around those eddies. I learnt that the physical and biological processes that occur within the ocean are critical to supporting our existence on Earth.
