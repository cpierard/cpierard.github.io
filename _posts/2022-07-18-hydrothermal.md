The deep ocean is the least explored place on Earth and possibly in the closest vicinity of our solar system. The massive expanse of the ocean and the challenging conditions in its deepest parts create an extreme environment in which our exploration capacity is bounded by the current technological advances. Historically, the lack of knowledge of the deep ocean created misconceptions about the shape of the seafloor, how the ocean flowed in its deepest regions, and the fauna found at its deepest regions. Although, during the last century, many discoveries challenged these ideas and revolutionized completely the field of oceanography.

In particular, the revolution began in 1959 when Marie Tharp and \cite{heezen1959floors} published the first global map of the ocean floor, in which they discovered the existence of the Mid Ocean Ridges (MOR). This discovery was a paradigm shift in geology because it was conclusive evidence that confirmed the plate tectonics hypothesis~\citep{kunzig2000mapping}. Around the same time, more evidence came to light of the existence of deep water currents that provided cold and oxygen-rich water to all the ocean basins \citep{stommel1958circulation}. In two seminal articles, \cite{stommel1959abyssali, stommel1959abyssalii} proposed a hypothesis that explained the mechanisms of deep water formation and distribution of the oceans basins, by predicting the existence of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). Their work launched several expeditions to measure those features in which new technologies were developed, such as the Swallow floats build by \cite{swallow1955neutral}.  Throughout these oceanographic campaigns, they were able to detect some of the features of the MOC and also demonstrated that the deep ocean circulation was turbulent, something that contradicted the idea of a motionless ocean.

One of the biggest discoveries in deep ocean science came in 1977, with the discovery of hydrothermal vents. Previous to that year, oceanographers collected evidence of possible hydrothermal activity in the seafloor, such as measurements of basins in the Red Sea filled with warm and salty water that contrasted with the near-freezing deep water temperatures \citep{degens1969hot}, and the detection of plumes of water containing an excess of Helium-3 in the Galapagos Rise, which could only come from the interaction between the lithosphere and the ocean water~\citep{clarke1969excess}. By 1977 an American expedition was launched to explore the Galapagos Rise in search of the suspected hot springs. In an article, the leader of the expedition \cite{ballard1977notes} mentions that when they localized the vents and dived to that spot, they were astonished to find otherworldly ecosystems full of life, that defied our understanding of life itself. It demonstrated that complex and diverse ecosystems could exist in the deep ocean, out of the reach of sunlight.

Deep in the ocean, immense knowledge voids remain waiting to be explored. These rich environments face the rampant destruction caused by human activity, threatening to disappear before we fully understand them. Therefore, there is an urgency to explore these knowledge voids in which each deep-sea immersion and instrument deployment has a great potential to advance our understanding of deep ocean environments. In particular, hydrothermal vents are threatened by deep-sea mining due to the large deposits of rare minerals around the vents. While we just began to explore them, many questions about their importance for the ocean remain open, such as their contribution to ocean circulation, the transport of nutrients, and many more.
